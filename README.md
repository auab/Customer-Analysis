# Customer-Analysis

This project aims to execute a customer segmentation process with a dataset available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) using machine learning techniques. The task is accomplished following the methodology detailed in [Aurelien Geron's book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

The study goes through all the steps, going from the data wrangling to the analysis of the developed model's results. As an example of the final step of the work, the image depicted below presents the customers already divided into the result groups distributed in different pairs of attributes.
